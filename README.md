- 👋 Hi, I’m @dnclain
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching code and code architecture. I speak fluently ... 'programming mind' (Incidentally PHP, Golang, Python, Java ecosystem, Typescript and C++)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ 17 / Rust / Code generation / Practical IA / Design System 
- 💞️ Do you have any usefull ideas I can work on ? I like to modelize them and generate code in above languages. 
- 📫 Reach me on LinkedIn.
